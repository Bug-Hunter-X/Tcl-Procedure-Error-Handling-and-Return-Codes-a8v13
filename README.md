This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming related to error handling within procedures. The `bug.tcl` file showcases a scenario where a procedure returns an error, but the calling code doesn't explicitly check for the error condition, resulting in silent failure or unexpected output.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.tcl`, shows how to properly handle error returns using `catch` and provides more robust error reporting.
